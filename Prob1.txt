Prompt: Write a short explanation of what is Node.js and how is it related to JavaScript.

Answer: Node.js is an open-source server-side Javascript run-time environment. Node.js is pretty amazing because it allows us to write server-side Javascript code, which historically was only possible on the client-side. Node.js is also advantageous because it utilizes an evet-driven architecture that uses asynchronous input/output which optimizes the speed and scalability of Web Applications.
